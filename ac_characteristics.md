## Domain research into 3-phase power

# frequency
There is a nominal frequency defined for the grid and around this there is a
normal operating frequency band. outside this band and supply interruptions may occur.
# voltage magnitude
There is an expected RMS and peak voltage. This can vary +-10% depending on customer load.
Voltage dips or sags are due to distribution faults or motor starts.
**can I get the customers KVA rating? This is linked to their transformer**
# power factor
# phase difference
# Voltage unbalance
Can occur because of customer loads or distribution phase loads or impedendences.
Limits on how different phases can be, otherwise outage.
# Harmonic content
Customer equipment or nearby loads can cause harmonic distortions in the voltage and
current signals.
# Brownouts
This is when one phase disappears, meaning supply is available but less power
